For this project we will be performing Analysis trying to predict if the patient is likely to have a heart failure. The features of the data are as follows:

Features:
1. Age: age of the patient [years]

2. Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

3. ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

4. RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

5. Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

6. FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

7. RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

8. MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved 

9. ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

10. Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

11. ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

13. HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
